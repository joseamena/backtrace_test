# backtrace_test

Simple Calculator Application to evaluate the Backtrace SDK

It can perform simple operations only once, to perform an operation:
1. enter a number
2. hit enter
3. enter a second number
4. hit enter
5. hit an operation button (+, -, *, /)

To cause an exception at the Kotlin layer, push the operation buttons without entering any numbers

To cause an expection at the C++ layer, try dividing by 0, example
1. enter 3
2. hit enter
3. enter 0
4. hit enter
5. hit / button
